# MSTFPOS


Hello, I wasn't able to upload the system uncompressed as there were too many files for GitHub
I am still somewhat a beginner so please bear with me as I've developed this system in NetBeans IDE and it generated a lot of files
You just have to uncompress it to a folder and access the executable file POSv3\dist\POSv3.jar :)

This system uses an embedded database called Derby.
